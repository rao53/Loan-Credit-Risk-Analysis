# Loan-Credit-Risk-Analysis
Credit cards are widely used in our time. Nowadays, people look at your credit to lend you money. Banks, companies, and lenders look at your credit information in order to assess the amount of money that they can lend. However, even if oneâ€™s credit looks fine at the beginning, one can become a credit card defaulter in a minute, making the lenders lose their profit. Our application seeks to find out what interesting rules lie in people who borrow money from others and become credit card defaulters. This application seeks to allow lenders to have an almost accurate evaluation of the person who is borrowing money and assume whether lending to such individuals would be good or not. This application would be extremely useful especially if you are a prospective lender.
